# PlotSwitch
Code for my project on the effects of changing rodent treatments on plots at Portal in 2015. Specifically, I'm looking for evidence of priority effects in slowing the re-colonization of kangaroo rats on patches from which they were excluded, but were opened to them through changing the experimental treatments. 

## Main analysis scripts
  * __create_data_series.R__ code for creating timeseries data for analysis
  * __data_functions.R__ functions used in create_data_series.R
