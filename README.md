# PlotSwitch
Code for my project on the effects of changing rodent treatments on plots at Portal in 2015. Specifically, I'm looking for evidence of priority effects in slowing the re-colonization of kangaroo rats on patches from which they were excluded, but were opened to them through changing the experimental treatments. 

## Main analysis scripts
  * __Dipo_GAM_analysis.Rmd__ GAM analysis of dipodomys count data
  * __create_data_series.R__ code for creating timeseries data for analysis
  * __data_functions.R__ functions used in create_data_series.R

## Data files
  * __Dipo_counts.csv__ counts by plot and sampling time
  * __Dipo_abundance_by_treatment.csv__ counts by sampling time and treatment -- plots pooled by treatment type
