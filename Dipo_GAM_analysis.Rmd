To do:
  - add seasonal model?
  - find way to plot resulting models with vertical line for plot switch, and horizontal line at 0 (showing no difference between treatment and control)


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(mgcv)
library(ggplot2)

source('gam_functions.R')
source('data_functions.R')
```

# Portal Plot Flip using gam()


## Load Data

Data is coming straight from the repo. This code is extracting the dipo 
abundances from the straight controls (CC), and the opened krat (EC) and rodent 
(XC) exclosures. This data runs from period 415 (3/13/2013) to present

```{r}
# load data. I saved the data series to csv because it takes a few minutes to create them from scratch from create_data_series.R
dipoN_avg = read.csv('Dipo_abundance_by_treatment.csv')

dipoN_avg$censusdate = as.Date(dipoN_avg$censusdate)
dipoN_avg
#knots <- list(month = c(0.5, seq(1, 12, length = 10), 12.5))
```


## Basic Season-trend model with factors

Here's a graph of the basic patterns in the data by treatment type. We see
the pure control plots (green) are relative stable through time (dip in most 
recent months) and the increase of the kangaroo rats on the two opened plots, 
with the number of kangaroo rats appearing higher on the opened rodent 
exclosures (blue) than the kangaroo rat exclosures (red)


```{r}
ggplot(dipoN_avg, aes(x = censusdate, y =n, colour = treatment)) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_smooth(method = 'loess', se = FALSE) +
    scale_colour_brewer(type = 'qual', palette = 'Dark2') +
    theme(legend.position = 'top') +
  geom_vline(xintercept=as.Date('2015-04-10'))
```

## GAM model - ordered factor for treatment type

This is strictly following Gavin's post-- the second one on ordered factors

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
# create ordered factor
dipoN_avg = mutate(dipoN_avg, oTreatment = ordered(treatment, levels = c('CC','EC','XC')))

# add site code to the model as a factor
m <- gam(n ~ treatment + s(numericdate) + s(numericdate, by = oTreatment), data = dipoN_avg)

plot(m, shade = TRUE, pages = 1, scale = 0, seWithMean = T)
summary(m)
```



 
```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
# add seasonality
dipoN_avg$month = as.numeric(format.Date(dipoN_avg$censusdate, "%m"))


```
