# PlotSwitch
Code for my project on the effects of changing rodent treatments on plots at Portal in 2015. Specifically, I'm looking for evidence of priority effects in slowing the re-colonization of kangaroo rats on patches from which they were excluded, but were opened to them through changing the experimental treatments.
